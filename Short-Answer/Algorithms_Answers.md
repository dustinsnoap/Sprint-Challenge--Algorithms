#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
You start with n^2; you need n more n's to get to n^3

b) O(n^2)
for loop = O(n)
nested while loop = O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n)
multiply them because they're nested
O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)

c) O(n)
There is only 1 operation per ear
